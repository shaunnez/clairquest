🧭 PROJECT PROMPT — Claire Quest (Romantic Scavenger Website)

Build a mobile-first Next.js 14 + TailwindCSS web app called “Claire Quest”, designed as a romantic treasure hunt.

Typography:

Headings: Rounded friendly display (e.g., “Quicksand”, “Baloo 2”).

Body: “Inter”.

Libraries:

react-bits for animated text and backgrounds.

framer-motion for fades and sparkle animations.

howler for background audio.

Tailwind for layout + responsive styles.

📱 Global Layout

Mobile-first, fits one hand scroll.

Animated background (Autumn Leaves or Liquid Ether from react-bits).

Persistent top bar: tiny heart icon + music toggle.

Persistent bottom bar: “Next” button with sparkly pulse on tap.

Background music toggle remembers state in localStorage.

Bring comfy shoes and your silly goose energy.

Starbucks

First sip, happy heart ☕

You can open your first voucher now.

UGG

Soft steps for our getaway 🧦
Pick the fluffiest pair that makes you smile.
Think of our weekend away — you, me, soft socks, no alarms.

Lunch

Lunch with your goose 🦢
Text me when you’re ready — you already have my location, love.

Tonight, city lights and you 🌆
Dinner at 5pm. Dress comfy-cute — think “Taylor Swift in love.”
I’ll text you the spot later.

Pasta (hidden unlock)

Hands in flour, hearts full 🍝
We’ve got a pasta-making class at Pasta & Cuore.
But there’s something else... press and hold for 10 seconds.

You make ordinary days sparkle. You calm my chaos. You are my favorite adventure.
Can’t wait for our weekend away.
— Your Goose 🦢

🧠 Secret Logic

Implement a useHoldGesture() hook:

When user holds touch for 10s on /pasta, animate glowing progress ring.

After 10s → auto-navigate to /finale.

Add subtle “you found it!” animation.

⚙️ Tech Implementation

Next.js App Router

Pages folder or route group: /quest/[step] if dynamic routing preferred.

Reusable PageLayout component with background + music controls.

Config-driven content (each page defined in QUEST_STEPS array).

Deploy on Vercel.

🎁 Optional Enhancements

Confetti burst on final page.

Animated heart cursor trail.

Simple preload of all audio assets.

Subtle progress dots in header (filled as you advance).

✅ Deliverables

Generate:

Complete next.config.js, Tailwind config, and color theme.
